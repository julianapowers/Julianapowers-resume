        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Juliana Powers and I am a first year at UC Riverside with a Political Science major. I currently work at Starbucks and do tasks such as work the oven, do register, bar (make drinks) cleaning duties, etc. My job qualifications include my possession of a food handler’s card, cash handling diploma, PCI diploma, and abusive conduct in the workplace diploma. Before attending UC Riverside, I went to John C. Kimball High in Tracy, California. I maintained a 3.8 GPA throughout high school and was enrolled in multiple AP classes. During highschool, I was in the Medical Health Services Academy which included classes such as Health Concepts, Medical Terminology, Human Physiology, etc.
<br>

        Throughout high school I also worked as a volunteer with groups such as MJPFA. I would volunteer at groups of this event such as their Halloween carnival in October. I would help facilitate games located at an after school carnival and also hand out prizes. During highschool I was also awarded the Academic Block K award which is awarded to students once a year. You are eligible to receive the Academic Block K award if: 1. You have straight A’s or a GPA of 4.0 or higher and 2. 10th graders with a 3.94 or higher, 11th graders with a 3.85 or higher, and 12th graders with a 3.75 or higher. I was also awarded the California Seal of Biliteracy which is awarded to graduating high school seniors who demonstrate proficiency in English and one or more languages in addition to English. I took Spanish from 8th grade-11th grade finishing off with Spanish 4. I was awarded a scholarship from the Rotary Club of Tracy. The Tracy Rotary Club has existed for 93 years in Tracy, California. In 2022, the group awarded over $18,000 in scholarship money to 24 high school seniors in Tracy, California. I used this money to help pay for some of my fees to attend UC Riverside.
<br><br>

        I am currently a first year Political Science major at UC Riverside. With my degree, I plan on going to law school at UC Berkeley law school which is close to my home and become a corporation lawyer. I am also interested in becoming a criminal justice lawyer. I also like the idea of being a Political Science professor at a University and conducting my own research there; maybe even writing a book about my research. I also want to do an internship job, maybe working at the local mayor's office or working for a running politician. I have a lot of job experience and references so hopefully I will be able to work a paid internship.
